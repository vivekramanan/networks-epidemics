Final project on Epidemic behaviors of Random graphs vs scale-free graphs

Conclusions:
When simulating an SIS model on random and scale-free graphs, random graphs show an epidemic threshold (of the spreading probability) under which the SIS model does not spread. In contrast, scale-free graphs do not show this threshold and leading to epidemic spreadings (at low levels) regardless of what the spreading probability is. 
Additionally, scale-free graphs require both the in and out degree distributions to be scale free to show this behavior, otherwise they behave like random graphs. 
Finally, it is important to consider that most real world networks are scale free because they contain hubs, therefore SIS models can give more insight into how epidemics spread.
